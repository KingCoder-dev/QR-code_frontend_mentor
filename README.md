## My process

After typing up the html, I made my variables and global styling then proceeded to centering the card using flexbox and did the necessary styling for each element.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learn to effectively use margin auto to properly center a div , using rem for font size, and variables in root

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```css
.:root{
--White: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);
--Lightgray: hsl(212, 45%, 89%);
--Grayishblue: hsl(220, 15%, 55%);
--Darkblue: hsl(218, 44%, 22%);
}

### Continued development

i want to improve on structuring my html properly further my skills in css by improving on flexbox and sizing and media queries.
